Hi there!

We're just after **Polish Perl Workshop 2014** in Poznan. It was awesome, thank you guys for being there.

There was a lot of very interesting talks. You can find them [here](http://act.yapc.eu/plpw2014/talks).

Thanks to Wendy, we have a lot of [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wendyga/sets/72157644316048078/)!

Gdansk volunteered to organize the workshop next year! Yay ! \o/

See you there!
